## Description
A react porfolio website built using my new react skills. When you open the page you are presented with the header which includes a nav 
bar and a footer which includes links to my github repo and linkedin profile. The home page is the about me and if you navigate to the top you can go to the 
portfolio page where I show some of the projects that I built or helped to build. There is also a contact me page where you can input you name and email along with a
message. Lastly is my resume page where you can view my resume.
